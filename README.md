=================

This repository contains the source for my [homepage](http://trananh.github.io).

It is based on Mark Reid's [design](http://mark.reid.name), with modifications made by me.


## Usage

You are welcomed to use this repository as a template for your own website.  However, you may consider
using Mark Reid's original [version](https://github.com/mreid/mark.reid.name).  If you do decide to
use my adaptation, it would be appreciated if you link back to my site, but not necessary.

While the design is free for use, the _contents_ contained within are not.
PLEASE ensure that you remove all of my personal data from your own site.
In particular, do the following before uploading your website:

* Remove my `data` folder.
* Remove all of my posts in the `_posts` folder.
* Remove images of me in the `images` folder.
* My personal Google Analytics tracking code is hardcoded in `_layouts/base.html`. It should be changed/removed.

Basically, the rules are:

* _If you don't understand it or didn't write it, then remove it_.
* _If it contains identifiable information or information generated by me, then remove it._
* _Test your site on a local machine before you upload your site_.

Cheers and happy developing!


## Thanks
