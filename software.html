        <h1>vlsa</h1>
        <p>
            The culmination of my dissertation. VLSA is a system for identifying
            latent scene attributes in videos. The system uses information contained
            in large collections of text documents to infer latent attributes in video
            scenes, such as the mental states of actors. This project is currently
            under development. Please check back soon for more information.

        <h1>ua-gesture</h1>
        <p>A gesture/action recognition package that implements the frequency forest
            action recognition model, based on the Subspace Forest approach.
            Annotation data for the KTH-Actions dataset is also included.

        <h1>word2vec<br/>scala</h1>
        <p>A Scala port of the word2vec model. This Scala interface allows the user
            to access the vector representation output by the word2vec toolkit. Note
            that it does NOT implement training algorithms. Several useful operations
            on the vectors are also provided.

        <h1>webapi-scala</h1>
        <p>This maven package provides Scala implementations of several common web
            search APIs (e.g., Google, Bing, Faroo, and Twitter search/stream).
            Note that you will need to provide your own API keys.

        <h1>swirl-osx</h1>
        <p>This is a Mac OSX compatible version of the original SwiRL system, developed
            by Mihai Surdeanu. The source is verified to build in OSX Snow Leopard,
            using gcc 4.2.1.

        <h1>swirl-nlp</h1>
        <p>A C++ wrapper of SISTA's CoreNLP processor documents (written in Scala).
            This interface allows us to load documents annotated using CoreNLP into
            SwiRL for semantic roles labeling, which has the advantage of using
            CoreNLP's POS tagger and named-entity engine to bootstrap SwiRL.
