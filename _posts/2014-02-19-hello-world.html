<p>
    Hello all and welcome to my first ever blog post.  Since this is the first, please bear with me as
    I perfect the secret arts of blogging.  To be completely honest, the main purpose of this post is
    to be the testbed for various blog designs and formats.  So don't be surprised if I ninja in
    some (seemingly) random links, lists, images, and footnotes. That said, this is also a great
    opportunity to introduce myself.  After all, this website is meant to be my portal to the
    outside world!
</p>

<p>It would seem I am a bit too busy (or lazy) to finish the rest of this post.</p>
<p>Have no worries, it will get done!! .. eventually.</p>
