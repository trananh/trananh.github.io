        <h1>vlsa</h1>
        <p>
            The culmination of my dissertation. VLSA is a system for identifying
            latent scene attributes in videos. The system uses information contained
            in large collections of text documents to infer latent attributes in video
            scenes, such as the mental states of actors. This project is currently
            under development. Please check back soon for more information.

        <h1>ua-gesture</h1>
        <p>A gesture/action recognition package that implements the frequency forest
            action recognition model, which is based on the Subspace Forest model.
            The project was written in Python and MATLAB, and also includes bounding-box
            annotation data for the <i>KTH-Actions</i> dataset.

        <h1>word2vec-scala</h1>
        <p>A Scala port of the <i>word2vec</i> model. This Scala interface allows users
            to access the trained vector representation of the word2vec toolkit. Note
            that it does NOT implement the training algorithms, but does include
            several useful word-operations (such as distance, analogy, etc.).

            You will need to provide your own API keys!

            documents (written in Scala). This interface allows users to load documents
            annotated using processors into SwiRL for semantic roles labeling, which has the
            advantage of using CoreNLP's POS tagger and named-entity recognizer to bootstrap
            SwiRL.
