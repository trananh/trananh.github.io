        <h1>vlsa</h1>
        <p>The product of my PhD dissertation. VLSA is a system for identifying
            latent attributes in video scenes, focusing on the mental states of
            participating actors. The main idea is to use information acquired
            from large collections of text corpora to help infer latent attributes
            in video scenes.  We do this by using explicit features of videos,
            such as detections about the activities and actors, to query large text
            corpora, and from the resulting texts extract attributes that are
            latent in the videos, such as actors' mental states.

        <h1>ua-gesture</h1>
        <p>A gesture/action recognition package that implements the frequency forest
            action recognition model, which is based on the Subspace Forest model.
            The project was written in Python and MATLAB, and also includes bounding-box
            annotation data for the <i>KTH-Actions</i> dataset.

        <h1>word2vec-scala</h1>
        <p>A Scala port of the <i>word2vec</i> model. This Scala interface allows users
            to access the trained vector representation of the word2vec toolkit. Note
            that it does NOT implement the training algorithms, but does include
            several useful word-operations (such as distance, analogy, etc.).

        <p>This maven package provides Scala implementations of several common web

            You will need to provide your own API keys!

            documents (written in Scala). This interface allows users to load documents

            advantage of using CoreNLP's POS tagger and named-entity recognizer to bootstrap
            SwiRL.
