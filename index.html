    <p>I'm Anh Tran, a Ph.D. graduate from the Computer Science department at the University of Arizona
        (UA). I also received my M.S. from UA in 2011, and my B.S. from Oregon State University in 2009.
    </p>
    <p>At the start of my graduate career, I dabbled in all things AI, including research in cognitive
        architecture, computer vision, robotics, and machine learning.  Towards the end, I focused
        primarily on natural language processing and information extraction.  My dissertation topic
        involved using information acquired from large collections of text documents to help
        identify latent scene attributes, such as mental states of actors, in videos (VLSA).
    </p>
    <p>On my free time, I enjoy the usual temptations: video games, movies, sports, etc.. Once upon of
        time, I was a decent basketball player. I have now transitioned to pool and billiards. And
        of course, I love programming.</p>
    <p>Take a look around, something might peak your interest.</p>
    <p>Cheers.</p>
