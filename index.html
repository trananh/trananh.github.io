    <p>I'm Anh Tran, a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science department at the University of Arizona.
        I received my B.S. from Oregon State University in 2009, and my M.S. from UA in 2011.
    </p>
    <p>Early in my graduate career, I dabbled with all things AI, including research in cognitive
        architecture, computer vision, robotics, and machine learning.  Currently, I focus
        primarily on natural language processing and computer vision.  My dissertation topic
        involves using information acquired from large collections of text documents to help
        identify latent scene attributes in videos (VLSA).
