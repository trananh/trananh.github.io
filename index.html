    <p>My name is <span itemprop="givenName">Anh</span> <span itemprop="familyName">Tran</span>.  I currently work as
        a <span itemprop="jobTitle">Software Developer</span>
        for <span itemprop="affiliation">General Motors</span>.
        I received my <span itemprop="honorificSuffix">Ph.D.</span>
        (2014) &amp; M.S. (2011) from the
        <span itemprop="alumniOf">University of Arizona</span>, and my B.S. (2009) from
        <span itemprop="alumniOf">Oregon State University</span>.
    </p>

    <p>In graduate school, I focused primarily on Artificial Intelligence (AI).  I dabbled in all things AI
        during my first few years of grad school, including research in cognitive
        architecture, computer vision, robotics, and machine learning.  Towards the end, I focused
        primarily on natural language processing and information extraction.  My dissertation topic
        involved using information acquired from large collections of text documents to help
        identify latent scene attributes, such as mental states of actors, in videos (VLSA).
    </p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy the usual temptations: video games, movies, sports, etc.. Once upon of
        time, I was a decent basketball player and played competitive table tennis. I have now transitioned to
        pool/billiards. (And of course, I love programming.)</p>

    <p>Take a look around, something might peak your interest.</p>

    <p>Cheers,<br/>
